Tourists travel every year to explore not just the monuments, historical locations, and festivities; they also travel to enjoy the diverse food options.  The food staples of New York City are known throughout the world and include pizza, cheesecake, sandwiches, and bagels.  The inflow of tourists every year, coupled with the residential population, make New York City a prime location for new up-and-coming food service locations looking to meet a high demand.  "

First, I need to determine the distribution of venues, by category, across New York City in order to determine which areas already have a high density of coffee shops, bakeries, and bagel shops.  This will be completed by pulling the venue data from Foursquare and conducting a k-means analysis in order to cluster neighborhoods into groups based on their most common venues.  From this, I can deduce which neighborhoods (and associated borough) have a high or low density of aforementioned venues.  With the list of low-density neighborhoods, I can cross-reference which boroughs have the highest current population and expected growth in order to determine which locations have the greatest potential for future earnings.
