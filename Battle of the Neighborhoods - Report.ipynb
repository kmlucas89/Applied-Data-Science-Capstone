Tourists travel every year to explore not just the monuments, historical locations, and festivities; they also travel to enjoy the diverse food options.  The food staples of New York City are known throughout the world and include pizza, cheesecake, sandwiches, and bagels.  The inflow of tourists every year, coupled with the residential population, make New York City a prime location for new up-and-coming food service locations looking to meet a high demand.  "

The steps will determine the venues across New York City, cluster the neighborhoods by venue type, identify those neighborhoods with high/low densities of similar venues, and then cross-reference those neighborhoods with the expectation for population growth in order to identify the best neighborhoods for both criteria.  \n\n### 4.1.1. Step 1 will analyze the distribution of venues across New York City.  With the New York City JSON file, I developed a dataframe that listed each neighborhood within New York City by their borough and providing their geographic coordinates.  I then drew from the Foursquare application all venues within New York City and created a dataframe of those locations.  I merged the two dataframes to create a single dataframe that provided all venues, their neighborhoods, Borough, and geographic coordinates.  \n\n### 4.1.2. Step 2 took the dataframe from Step 1 and refocused efforts on neighborhoods.  Using one-hot encoding, the venues were analyzed by neighborhood, creating a new dataframe.  The new dataframe provided the frequency of each venue type by neighborhood, which was then converted to list the top ten venue types in each neighborhoods.  \n\n### 4.1.3. Step 3 built upon step 2 by using k-means clustering to group neighborhoods by venue types.  This provided groups of neighborhoods with similar venues.  These groups are then analyzed to determine which groups have a high/low density of venues similar to coffee/bagel/dessert shops.  The high density venue neighborhoods are discarded.  The low density venue neighborhoods are retained for further analysis.    \n\n### 4.1.4. Step 4 took the results from Steps 1-3 and cross-referenced potential neighborhoods with the expected population growth across the next twenty years.  "
